# Implementation of red-black binary search tree

### Tests
A naive test program is included (**tree_test.c**).  
Any changes to the functions:  
*rotate_left*, *rotate_right*, *node_add* within **tree_redblack.c**, should be updated in **tree_test.c** as well.  
To compile the test program, run *make tree*
